High Fidelity has been designed to be an immersive and interactive experience. Your system should meet the following requirements to run Interface and Sandbox.

## Minimum System Requirements

### Windows 
* Windows 7 64-bit
* Intel i5-4590 processor
* 8GB of RAM
* NVIDIA GTX 970 graphics card _or_  
AMD R9 290 graphics card

### Mac 
* OS X Mavericks (version 10.9)
* 8GB of RAM 
* 2017 Macbook Pro 15" with AMD Radeon Pro 560 _or_  
2018 Macbook Pro 15" with AMD Radeon Pro 560X _or_  
2017 iMac Pro

### Linux 
* Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit
* 8GB of RAM
* Intel i5-4590 processor
* NVIDIA GTX 970 graphics card

### Android
* Daydream-enabled Android devices

## Bandwidth Recommendations
We design/test for a 10Mbps connection, however the system will work at less.  Voice chat requires 100Kbps upwards, 200Kbps downward, so you need at least a 1Mbps or so connection to be able to function.

##Additional Hardware Requirements

While a lot of High Fidelity’s features are available with a desktop, for the best experience, we recommend using VR hardware such as head mounted displays (HMD), hand controllers and audio headsets.  HMDs are display devices that allow the user to view virtual reality. Hand controllers will help you navigate and create in-world. Finally, High Fidelity delivers all audio over UDP in an uncompressed 16-bit, 24Khz format, and spatializes audio in real-time based on the location of the listener and the sound sources. A good headset will enhance your experience. 

We’ve listed the hardware requirements below. 

>>>>>Ensure that your system meets the requirements for whichever additional hardware equipment you choose to use.
