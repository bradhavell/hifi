We’ve listed some basic terms that will help you understand how High Fidelity works and what you can do in-world. 

##Interface

When you first [install High Fidelity](../../installation), you’ll be prompted to download the Interface and Sandbox. 
The [**Interface**](../../../create-and-explore/explore-interface) is our client. This means that when you launch Interface, you can explore VR worlds created in High Fidelity and interact with other users. You can visit your friend's VR world, meet people, attend events and even go for a class on avatar creation. It's an immersive and interactive experience with realistic visuals and audio. 



##Sandbox

If you’re interested in creating your own world and sharing it with other users, you’ll need the [**Sandbox**](../../../create-and-explore/start-working-in-your-sandbox). The Sandbox is your space, where you can create anything you’d like. When you run the Sandbox, your system is functioning as a server. This means you are hosting your own Sandbox. You, or any other user, can access your Sandbox from the Interface by typing in its place name or URL. You can control who visits your Sandbox by modifying your server settings.  



##Domain

Your Sandbox is your home **domain**. A world created by any user is a domain. If you want to attend a live event organized by some users, you have to go to the specified domain to participate. A domain is the name given to a bounded region or place and each domain is controlled by a domain server and given a domain ID. When you use your Sandbox, your system is your home domain server. Just like your Sandbox, you can access a domain either using the place name, domain name, or the URL/IP of that domain. 



##Entities

To build any content in your Sandbox, whether it is a space to interact with users or a replica of your apartment, you need [**entities**](../../../create-and-explore/entities). Entities are any object that are inside of a High Fidelity domain.  They are similar to the concept of Game Objects in Unity. You need entities whether you are going to create a theater or a chair. They are the basic blocks with which you can create and explore in High Fidelity.

There are different kinds of entities available for use:
* [Box and Sphere entities](../../../create-and-explore/entities/box-and-sphere-entities)
* [Model entities](../../../create-and-explore/entities/model-entities)
* [Light entities](../../../create-and-explore/entities/light-entities)
* [Particle entities](../../../create-and-explore/entities/particle-entities)
* [Text entities](../../../create-and-explore/entities/text-entities)
* [Web entities](../../../create-and-explore/entities/web-entities)
* [Zone entities](../../../create-and-explore/entities/zone-entities)

You can use any of these entities to create your very own virtual world. 



##Avatar

To experience High Fidelity, you will need an [**avatar**](../../../create-and-explore/avatars). An avatar is a representation of you in the virtual world. When you first launch Interface, your avatar will be a default avatar assigned by High Fidelity. You are free to create your own avatar using other software and importing into High Fidelity. Learn more about avatar creation [**here**](../../../create-and-explore/avatars/create-avatars). 



##Scripting

What happens if you want to add a pet to your domain and make sure it follows you wherever you go? Or if you want the lamps in your medieval village to turn on at night? High Fidelity provides you with the option to modify the functioning of your environment using [**scripting**](../../../create-and-explore/all-about-scripting). You can use JavaScript to change the behavior of any in-world object, add UI elements or change your hand-controller functions. 

These scripts can be written using JavaScript. With scripts you can build structures, move your avatar, shoot guns, play audio at a specific location, create custom UI elements to display information that only you can see, play music only you can hear and much more. There are four different kinds of scripts in High Fidelity:
* Interface Scripts
* Client Entity Scripts
* Server Entity Scripts
* Assignment Scripts

Scripts can help you customize High Fidelity.
