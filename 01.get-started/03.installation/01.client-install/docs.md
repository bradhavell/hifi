The client only installer uses the same packaging code as the server/client installer. This means it looks and behaves mostly the same, but does not include the Sandbox.

+ The client only installer is named "High Fidelity Interface". The default install location is at "High Fidelity Interface" instead of "High Fidelity"
+ The client only installer only shows client related install options
  - It offers to create a desktop shortcut for Interface
  - It offers to launch Interface after the install
  - It offers to perform a clean install (removing older settings and content)
  - For PR builds it offers to copy settings and content from production install
