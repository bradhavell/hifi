		<h5>What is Mocap?</h5>
	    <p>Motion capture (mocap) has been a mainstay of movie and game graphics for years. It’s useful in situations where realistic human motion is important to convey emotion. Our response is more positive to accurately captured human movement rather than a computer simulation. Mocap rigs for movies and games have usually required body suits to capture real-time motion in specialized environments. But such rigs are expensive.</p>

		<h5>Mocap with Vive Trackers</h5>

		<h5>Adding Flavor to the Metaverse!</h5>
	    <p>High Fidelity’s mocap system can capture movement from your feet, hips, chest, and shoulders, depending on the number of trackers. You can buy trackers based on your requirements. The configurations we support are: 2 trackers for capturing feet only, 3 trackers for feet and hips, 4 trackers for feet, hips, and chest, and 5 trackers for feet, hips and shoulders. You can purchase HTC Vive trackers <a href='https://www.vive.com/us/vive-tracker/'>here</a>. Once you’ve decided the type of system you want, all you need to do is <a href='https://docs.highfidelity.com/create-and-explore/explore-interface/menu/mocap-system'>configure and calibrate</a>. </p>
