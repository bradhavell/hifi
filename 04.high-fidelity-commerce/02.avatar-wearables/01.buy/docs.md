- Let's first try on the glasses. If you're using an HMD with controllers, you can just pick up the glasses you want and place them on your face. You'll hear a small sound notification indicating that the wearable has been placed on the joint. If you're in Desktop mode, just click on the glasses of your choice. It will be placed around your avatar's head. You can adjust your wearables in VR mode by using moving it with your controllers. In Desktop mode, you can pull up your tablet, and go to the **Wear** app to adjust any wearable. You can use the mirrors in the store to see how you look.

You can also take them off in VR mode or delete them using the **Wear** app in Desktop mode. If you want to see how your avatar looks with various wearables on, you can look at yourself in one of the many mirrors in the store.
