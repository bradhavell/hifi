Avatar Wearables are objects that attach to your avatar. They can be hats, skirts, glasses, headphones and anything else that can accessorize your look in-world. 

You can create your own wearables or shop for some at Avatar Island. Avatar Island is a domain in High Fidelity where you can shop wearables in different stores.
