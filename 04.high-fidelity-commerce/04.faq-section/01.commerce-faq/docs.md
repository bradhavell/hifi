### Commerce Questions

**How can I get HFC?**<br> 
High Fidelity commerce is in open beta right now. Want more HFC? Get it by going to [Bank Of High Fidelity](https://hifi.place/BankOfHighFidelity) and meeting with the banker!

**How do I send HFC to other people?**<br> 
You can send HFC to a High Fidelity connection (someone you’ve shaken hands with in-world) or somebody Nearby (currently in the same domain as you). In the Inventory app’s Send Money tab, choose from your list of connections, or choose Nearby and select the glowing sphere of the person’s avatar.

**What is a Security Pic?**<br>
Your Security Pic acts as an extra layer of security for your transactions. When you see your Security Pic, you know that your actions and data are securely making use of your account.

**Where do I enter my passcode after updating?**<br>
In earlier releases, you were required to set up a passcode to access your Wallet and Purchases. In newer releases, this requirement has been removed, and we have integrated the security for your transactions into your High Fidelity account. Now, it is easier than ever to use your engage in commerce transactions.

If you need to go back and use an older version of High Fidelity, you can access your wallet using the passcode ACCOUNT.

**Why does my HFC balance not update instantly?**<br> 
HFC transactions sometimes take a few seconds to update as they are backed by a blockchain. [Learn more here](https://docs.highfidelity.com/high-fidelity-commerce).

**Do I get charged money if a transaction fails?**<br> 
**No**. Your HFC balance only changes after a transaction is confirmed.

**How do I convert HFC to other currencies?**<br> 
We are hard at work building the tools needed to support a vibrant economy in High Fidelity. At the moment, there is currently no way to convert HFC to other currencies. Stay tuned...
